Notes about Func Autosigning

This may work better for you if you are using Func autosigning,
otherwise the administrator will need to use certmaster-ca --sign
hostname (see also certmaster-ca --list) to deal with machines.

Not using autosigning is good if you don't trust all the hosts you
are provisioning and don't want to enslave unwanted machines.

Either choice is ok, just be aware of the manual steps required if
you don't enable it, or the implications if you do.
